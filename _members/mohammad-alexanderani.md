Alexanderani's research focuses on using digital pathology tools to predict important outcomes in various human diseases. Current projects include the prediction of response to TNF-alpha inhibition in ulcerative colitis from histo-pathology slides using deep learning, and the characterization of the signaling pathways driving prostate cancer initiation.
