Claudio Zanettini obtained his PhD in Psychobiology and Psychopharmacology from the University Sapienza of Rome (Italy) in 2010. While in Italy, he investigated the roles and interactions of environmental and genetic factors on the development of brain and behavior. For his postdoctoral training, he moved to the U.S where he worked in well-regarded behavioral pharmacology laboratory, and developed expertise in operant behavior techniques and quantitative pharmacology. He is currently a research fellow in the Medication Development Program where he is responsible for the preclinical evaluations of novel pharmacological therapies for cocaine abuse. In particular, he is focuses on the study of new atypical dopamine uptake inhibitors (i.e. benztropine and modafinil analogues) and on the use of behavioral economic analysis to evaluate effects of drugs.
