Dr. Omar's research focuses on harnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to investigate the mechanisms mediating cancer progression in patients affected with prostate and breast cancers. To this end, he has developed and applied robust computational and hybrid methods for deciphering the molecular and spatial dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, utilizing high resolution spatial proteomics and transcriptomics, as well as routine histopathology imaging data.
